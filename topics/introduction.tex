\chapter{Introduction}

This project aims to deliver a versatile voice assistant implementation
compatible with various frontends. One such frontend,
developed concurrently with this project,
leverages the Qt framework\footnote{Qt Framework \cite{qt}}
to provide a user-friendly interface.

\section{Background and Motivation}
Voice assistants have seen steady growth in adoption,
yet they are often perceived as supplementary tools
rather than essential components of productivity.
This project addresses this limitation by developing a voice assistant solution
that enhances user workflows while maintaining minimal intrusiveness.
The implementation extends traditional voice assistant capabilities
with advanced features, including workspace management and seamless speech-to-text integration.

\section{Project Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Achieving efficient processing with a target response latency of 1 second.
    \item Seamless integration into Linux window managers, enabling users to control their systems using voice commands.
    \item Support for both explicit recording and voice activation functionalities.
    \item Configurability, allowing users to select preferred algorithms, APIs, and output formats.
\end{itemize}
