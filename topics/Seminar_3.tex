\subsection{Summary}
\textbf{Current Status and Progress:\\} 
The schematic v2.0 and PCB v2.0 have been completed and have already arrived. Additionally, new calculations must be made for the dimensions of the case, as the display currently does not fit. The weather retrieval functionality is also operational.\\

\noindent\textbf{Next steps:\\}
The PCB will be assembled, and the project will undergo final testing. Additionally, the enclosure will be redesigned. For this, new measurements for the display are required, as well as adjustments to the button holes, since their positions have changed in PCB v2.0.
Furthermore, additional features are currently being programmed.
